# Markdown Reference Link

Insert Markdown link "[][1]" in the text and add "[1]: " at the end of the document. If there is a text selection, use it as the link text; if a URL is in the clipboard, place it at the end of the document with the reference number. Numbers used for references automatically increment each time.
