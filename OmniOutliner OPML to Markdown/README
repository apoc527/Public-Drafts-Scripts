This script takes an OPML file exported from OmniOutliner and turns it into a markdown file with the specified depth of headings.

Lines with a depth greater than the maximum heading depth are converted to markdown lists with the appropriate level of indentation. 

Currently does not support notes. [Pull requests welcome.](https://github.com/pdavisonreiber/Public-Drafts-Scripts/tree/master/OmniOutliner%20OPML%20to%20Markdown)
